* Overview
  A CLI program that takes input and renders it in an ANSI art font, and adds
  some colored oozz.
* Requirements
  This program relies heavily on VT100 / VT52 ANSI escape codes so your terminal
  would have to support this. The output is meant for unicode terminals, no
  reservations are made for older terminals. Currently only tested on Linux.
* Usage
  Basic usage would be simply calling oozz and the remaining input is treated as
  a string
  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    oozz some text
  #+END_SRC

  Supported characters are: ~abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz. !~ This somewhat limited
  at the moment, but I plan to add more.
* Options
  Aside from the green color used by default you can use any of the 16 colors
  supported by your terminal, with a combination of the color option ~--color
  black|red|green|yellow|blue|magenta|cyan|white~ and the ~--bold~ flag.

  Another option is the ability to center text using either ~-C~ or ~--center~ This
  is by no means foolproof, and if the program fails to get the width of the
  terminal, it prints an error message and continues without centering.

* Building
  Requires [[https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/][Rust]] and [[http://doc.crates.io/][Cargo]] installed on system, and is built like so:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    cargo build
  #+END_SRC

  An optional requirement would be [[https://github.com/pinard/Recode/][Recode]], a charset converter tool. The artwork
  files comes in two flavours, ~*.ans~ and ~*.latin1~, both filetypes are tracked in
  the repo but if you for some reason want to change the artwork, Recode is used
  for the conversion between the filetypes. Just edit something and run:

  #+BEGIN_SRC shell
  make
  #+END_SRC
